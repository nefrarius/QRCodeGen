# QRCodeGen
A QR code generator in Python takes user input (text, URL, etc.) and converts it into a QR code image using libraries like qrcode and qrcodeT. The program accepts input, processes it, and outputs a scannable QR code in image format (e.g., PNG). Itâ€™s customizable for size, color, and error correction levels.
